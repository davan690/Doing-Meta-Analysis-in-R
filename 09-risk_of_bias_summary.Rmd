# Risk of Bias summary

![A finished Risk of Bias summary](_figs/robplot.png)

In this Chapter, we will describe how to create a RevMan style Risk of Bias summary in *R*.

<br></br>

## Preparing your Risk of Bias data {#robprep}

In many Meta-Analyses, you will also want to have a look at the quality of included studies using the [**RevMan Risk of Bias assessment tool**](https://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_8/8_6_presentation_of_assessments_of_risk_of_bias.htm). However, many researchers don't use **RevMan** to conduct Meta-Analyses, one has to put some extra effort into inserting all study quality data by hand into RevMan, which is extremely time-consuming.

Furthermore, the quality of the Risk of Bias (RoB) summary figures in RevMan are of suboptimal picture quality. Many journals will require figures with better quality, or figures saved in another format (such as **.svg** or **.pdf**).

![This is the output created by RevMan.](_figs/robsummaryrevman.png)

To avoid all of this, you can easily plot the **RoB Summary in RStudio yourself**.
To do this, we again have to prepare an Excel sheet in which we store our RoB data. In [Chapter 3.1.1](#excel_preparation), we already described how the preparation and import of Excel sheets into RStudio works in general. For this data sheet, you need to follow a few guidelines:

* Name the first column **Author**, and put all the study names in this column (e.g., Frogeli et al.)
* Give the other **columns a name signifying the RoB criterion** you assessed. Do this for all criteria you want to have included in your plot. **Important**: when naming your column, do not use spaces between words, but use underscores or points instead (e.g. allocation_concealment)
* In these columns, you have to describe if the study received a **High**, **Low**, or **Unclear** risk of bias rating. Use exactly these codes for your data, including upper and lowercase (*R* is case sensitive).
* Do **not** store any other information in your data (e.g., commentaries on your RoB decision).

## Plotting the summary

To plot the summary, we have to import our dataset first. We describe how to do this in [Chapter 3.2](#import_excel). I simply called my dataset `rob`.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
load("_data/rob.RData")
rob<-rob_e
rob$Author<-rob$Study_ID
rob$Study_ID<-NULL

colnames(rob) =  c("Sequence_Generation"                      ,          
                   "Allocation_Concealment_"                 ,
                   "Blinding.of.Participants.and.Personnel"  ,
                   "Blinding.of.Outcome.Assessors"           ,
                   "Incomplete.Outcome.Data",
                   "Selective_Outcome_Reporting"             ,
                   "Cointerventions"                        ,
                   "Serious_Flaw"                            ,
                   "Intention_to_treat_Analyses"                                     ,
                   "Similar_Groups"                           ,
                   "Compliance"                              ,
                   "Identical_Post_Timing"                   ,
                   "Author") 
rob = as.data.frame(rob)

```

**Let's have a look at the structure of the data first:**

```{r}
str(rob)
```

We can see that we have the data imported in RStudio now, with ratings for every criterion in each column. Whether you named your columns differently or used less or more criteria is not important.

To plot the risk of bias summary, we have prepared a function called `rob.summary` for you. The `rob.summary` function is part of the [`dmetar`](#dmetar) package. If you have the package installed already, you have to load it into your library first.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dmetar)
```

If you don't want to use the `dmetar` package, you can find the source code for this function [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MathiasHarrer/dmetar/master/R/rob.summary.R). In this case, *R* doesn't know this function yet, so we have to let *R* learn it by **copying and pasting** the code **in its entirety** into the **console** in the bottom left pane of RStudio, and then hit **Enter ⏎**. The function then requires the `tidyr` and `ggplot2` package to work.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("dmetar/rob.summary.R")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

**The functions has the following parameters:**

```{r,echo=FALSE}
i<-c("data", "name.high", "name.unclear", "name.low", "studies", "name.missing", "table")
ii<-c("A data.frame containing a column for each risk of bias criterion, where rows represent each individual studies. The risk of bias assessment for each criterion for each study must be coded as a character string. Up to four codes can be used, referring to low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias, high risk of bias, or missing information. The string used to specify the categories must be specified in name.high, name.unclear, name.low and/or name.missing, unless defaults for those parameters are used.",
      "Character specifying how the 'high risk of bias' category was coded in data (e.g., name.high = 'high'). Default is 'High'.",
      "Character specifying how the 'unclear risk of bias' category was coded in data (e.g., name.unclear = 'unclear'). Default is 'Unclear'.",
      "Character specifying how the 'low risk of bias' category was coded in data (e.g., name.low = 'low'). Default is 'Low'.",
      "A vector of the same length as the number of rows in data specifying the study labels for the risk of bias ratings. Only has to be specified when table = TRUE.",
      "Character specifying how missing information was coded in data (e.g., name.missing = 'missing'). Default is 'Missing'. All ratings, including missing information, must be coded as strings, so using NA in data to signify missing information is not valid.",
      "Should an additional RevMan style risk of bias table be produced? If set to TRUE, studies must be specified. FALSE by default.")
ms<-data.frame(i,ii)
names<-c("Parameter", "Function")
colnames(ms)<-names
kable(ms) 
```

If you named the columns and Risk of Bias levels as suggested [before](#robprep), you only have to provide the `rob.summary` function with your dataset and the study labels in `studies`. As we want to produce both the summary plot and the *RevMan* Risk of Bias table, we specify `table` as `TRUE` (this is only possible if `studies` is specified). 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.align="center", eval=FALSE}
rob.summary(rob, studies = rob$Author, table = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.align="center"}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/robs1.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.align="center"}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/robs2.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

**Looks good so far**. As you can see, the `rob.summary` also detected words separated by "_" or "." in the column names and automatically cleaned the output from those symbols.

## Saving the Summary Plot {#saving}

I want to save the plot as a **PDF** file in my working directory. To do this, define the name of the file as `rob_summary.pdf`, and save it at the same time in the correct size and orientation using this code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pdf(file='rob_summary.pdf', width = 13, height = 6) 
rob.summary(rob); dev.off() 
```

I can also save the plot as **PNG** file using this command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
png(file='rob_summary.png', width = 900, height = 595) 
rob.summary(rob); dev.off() 
```

Or as a **Scalable Vector Graphic** (.svg) with this command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
svg(file='rob_summary.svg', width = 13, height = 6) 
rob.summary(rob); dev.off() 
```
