# About this Guide

![](_figs/coverbild.jpg)

```{block,type='rmdinfo'}
This guide shows you how to conduct Meta-Analyses in R from scratch. The focus of this guide is primarily on clinical outcome research in psychology. It was designed for staff and collaborators of the [**PROTECT Lab**](https://www.protectlab.org), which is headed by **Prof. Dr. David D. Ebert**.

**The guide will show you how to:**
 
* Get **R** and **RStudio** set for your Meta-Analysis.
* Get your data into R.
* **Prepare your data** for the meta-analysis.
* Introduce you to the `dmetar` *R* package we built specifically for this guide.
* Perform **fixed-effect** and **random-effects** meta-analysis using the `meta` and `metafor` packages.
* Analyse the **heterogeneity** of your results.
* Tackle heterogeneity using **subgroup analyses** and **meta-regression**.
* Check if **selective outcome reporting (publication bias)**  or **p-hacking** is a present in your data
* Summarize the **risk of bias** in your data
* Calculate the **power** of a meta-analysis
* **Convert effect sizes** reported in original studies to the ones you need for your meta-analysis.
* Do advanced types of meta-analyses, such as 
    + **multilevel meta-analyses**
    + **multivariate meta-analyses**
    + **meta-analytic structural equation modeling** or
    + **network meta-analyses**.

**What this guide will not cover**

Although this guide will provide some information on the statistics behind meta-analysis, it will not give you an **in-depth introduction** into how meta-analyses are calculated statistically.
  
It is also beyond the scope of this guide to advise in detail which meta-analytical strategy is suited best in which contexts, and on how the search, study inclusion and reporting of meta-analyses should be conducted. The [*Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions*](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/), however, should be a great source to find more information on these topics.

**Generally, there a two other sources to recommended when conducting Meta-Analyses:**
  
* If you're looking for a easily digestable, hands-on introduction on how Meta-Analyses are conducted, we can recommend **Pim Cuijpers' online courses on Meta-Analysis**. The courses are freely available on YouTube. To have a look, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP7_VBrG_TY&list=PL-h5cI5Bkvt0J-O0kq_9J9_aksWFPgR7s).
* If you're interested in more details on how to conduct Meta-Analyses in R, you can either have a look at Wolfgang Viechtbauer's page for the `metafor` package ([Link](http://metafor-project.org)). Or you can consult a book written by Schwarzer and colleagues on the `meta` package [@schwarzer2015meta].

**How to get the R code for this guide**

![](_figs/githublogo.png)

All code behind this book is available online on **GitHub**. We have created a website containing a **download link** for all codes, and a **quick guide** on how to get the code running on your computer. The site can be found [here](https://mathiasharrer.github.io/Doing-Meta-Analysis-in-R/).
